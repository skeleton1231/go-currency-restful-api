# Item Management API Documentation

## Overview

The Item API is designed to provide an interface for managing inventory items in an e-commerce system. It is structured around a three-tier architecture: Controller, Service, and Store. These layers work together to provide a robust and flexible solution for managing your inventory items.

## Controller Layer

The Controller layer is the entry point for the API, responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses. It validates input, calls the appropriate Service functions based on the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and formats the response to be sent back to the client.

## Service Layer

The Service layer provides the business logic for our API. It contains the core functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) items. The Service layer handles transactions, ensures data integrity, and calls the appropriate Store methods to interact with the database.

## Store Layer

The Store layer is responsible for data storage and retrieval. It communicates directly with the database to execute queries. This layer abstracts the database-specific details, making it possible to switch databases with minimal changes to the rest of the code.

## Field Search

The Item API supports advanced filtering using a field search feature. This allows users to filter results based on the value of specific fields in the database. The fields that can be searched are:

- `ASIN`
- `SKU`
- `Brand`
- `Title`
- `ProductGroup`
- `ProductType`

To use field search, include a `fieldSelector` parameter in your request with the format `field=value`. You can include multiple field-value pairs, separated by commas, to filter on multiple fields at once. For example, `fieldSelector=brand=Kuggini,title=headphones` would return items where the `brand` is `Kuggini` and the `title` contains `headphones`.

## Examples

Here's an example of a curl command to get items with a specific brand and title:

### Item list and advanced filter

```bash
curl -X GET -H'Content-Type: application/json' -H'Authorization: Bearer your_auth_token' "http://127.0.0.1:8883/v2/items?fieldSelector=brand%3DKuggini%2Ctitle%3Dheadphones&offset=0&limit=10"
```

In this example, `%3D` is the URL encoded equivalent of the `=` character, and `%2C` is the URL encoded equivalent of the `,` character. This is necessary because these characters have special meanings in URLs. The `fieldSelector` is `brand%3DKuggini%2Ctitle%3Dheadphones`, which is equivalent to `brand=Kuggini,title=headphones` when URL decoded.

### Create Item
```bash
curl -X POST -H'Content-Type: application/json' -H'Authorization: Bearer your_auth_token' -d '{"asin":"B0B3HXK001","title":"Kuggini Bone Conduction Headphones Bluetooth, Open-Ear Sports Headphones Wireless with Mic, Bluetooth 5.3, IPX6 Waterproof, Hi-Fi Sound Quality, Only 23g, Perfect for Workout, Running, Cycling 000000001","brand":"Kuggini","product_group":"","product_type":""}' http://127.0.0.1:8883/v2/items
```

### Update Item
``` bash
curl -X PUT -H'Content-Type: application/json' -H'Authorization: Bearer your_auth_token' -d '{"asin":"B0B3HXK000","title":"Kuggini Bone Conduction Headphones Bluetooth, Open-Ear Sports Headphones Wireless with Mic, Bluetooth 5.3, IPX7 Waterproof, Hi-Fi Sound Quality, Only 23g, Perfect for Workout, Running, Cycling 000-0001","sku":"LU-US-10000","brand":"Kuggini","product_group":"electronics","product_type":"headphones"}' http://127.0.0.1:8883/v2/items/10000
```

The Item API is a powerful tool for managing your e-commerce inventory. With its three-tier architecture and advanced field search feature, it provides a flexible and robust solution for all your inventory management needs.
