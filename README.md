IAM = **I**dentity and **A**access **M**management

IAM is an identity and access management system developed based on Go language, which is used to authorize resource access. **The latest stable version is: v1.6.2, it is recommended to install and test based on the stable version**.

Note here:
- If you are a reader of the "Go language project development practice" column of Geek Time, please use the v1.1.0 version (tag)
- If you are a reader of the book "Building an Enterprise Go Project from Scratch", please use the v1.6.t2 version (tag)


IAM also has the following capabilities:

1. Cooperate with the Geekbang Time column **《[Go language project development practice](https://time.geekbang.org/column/intro/100079601?tab=intro)》**, explain how to use Go to do enterprise-level applications The development of the project is the theoretical course of the project, which includes the explanation of various knowledge points and construction ideas of the project, as well as my first-line research and development experience and suggestions.

2. As a development scaffolding, developers can clone and develop their own applications quickly.

The IAM project will be maintained for a long time and updated regularly, **welcome brothers Star & Contribute**
