Item Services
 
The design follows a layered architecture pattern, which is a common approach for organizing code in a maintainable and scalable way. The main layers in this design are:

1. Handler (also known as the controller): Responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and managing the response. It receives the request, processes it using the service layer, and returns the response to the client.

2. Service: Contains the business logic of the application. It performs data processing, validation, and any other operations required by the application's domain.

3. Model: Represents the data structures of the domain objects. In this case, the domain objects are items and their related models like ItemAttributes, ItemImage, etc.

Here's a more detailed explanation of each layer:

**Handler Layer**

The handler layer is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and managing the response. In the example provided, the `handler.go` file contains a `NewItemHandler` function that initializes a new instance of the `ItemHandler` struct with the required dependencies, such as the `ItemService`.

The `ItemHandler` struct has a `RegisterRoutes` method that registers the item-related endpoints (such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting items) with the provided router group. Each handler function performs some basic request validation, calls the appropriate service method, and formats the response to be sent back to the client.

**Service Layer**

The service layer contains the core business logic of the application. The `service.go` file defines an `ItemService` interface that declares methods for CRUD operations related to items and their related models. The `itemServiceImpl` struct is an implementation of this interface and contains the actual logic for each operation.

The `NewItemService` function initializes a new instance of the `itemServiceImpl` struct with the required dependencies, such as a database connection or repository. The service methods implement the business logic for each operation, interacting with the data layer as needed.

**Model Layer**

The model layer represents the data structures of the domain objects. In this case, the domain objects are items and their related models, such as `ItemAttributes`, `ItemImage`, etc. The `model.go` file contains the definition of these structs, with each field tagged for database mapping.

By following this layered architecture, the code is organized in a maintainable and scalable way. Each layer has a specific responsibility, making it easier to understand the code, test individual components, and make changes when necessary.
